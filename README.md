# palmettoBlueAlliance

a repo for the python scripts I am using to start pulling data for scouting during the 2020 season.

The scripts leverage the Blue Alliance API found here: https://www.thebluealliance.com/apidocs/v3 The goal is to allow for users (currently the team I mentor 3490) to pull data from competitions (currently just Myrtle Beach and Knoxville) and look at the breakdowns of the scores for each team to scout the best robot for the best strategy with our robot.

Further iterations will allow for more general scouting and hopefully more data analysis

1st iteration is hard coded values for the upcoming palmetto event. 
2nd iteration after the event is to make the script more general
